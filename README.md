# Discover-Weekly Project 
#### The beginnings of a Spotify scraper project that I coded a couple of years ago. Plan to integrate Python code that uses machine learning (via SciKit learn):
- Training on characteristics of input songs (via music metadata API's) to compile new playlists for users out of similar ones to their top tracks (from Spotify API).
